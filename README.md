# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on improving my python coding ability and gaining a better understanding of python by doing doing some projects that will show off and also help me gain a better understanding of how to solve coding  problems.<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on python projects, and anything that would expose me to improving my skills as a coder.<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with gaining experience and finding new ways to challange myself and my coding abilities.<br>🌱 I’m currently learning data science and am always wiling to learn from others.<br>💬 Ask me about what projects im working on in the background so that I can get some feedback.<br>⚡ Fun fact I used to practice muay-thai and have gained a love for thai food as a result.
